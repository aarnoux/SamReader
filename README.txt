**** GENERAL PURPOSE ****

SamReader is a programm that analyses SAM files. It was developped with Python 3. It can analyse multiple files
in one go. Results are either shown in the terminal or written in an output file. Features include:
- Verifying the integrity of the files given as arguments.
- Reads that are unmapped are not taken into account for the calculations.
- Calculations for the percentages of mutations are based on the CIGAR field.


**** EXECUTION ****

Run the following command in the terminal to execute SamReader (output file field is optionnal):
$ ~/path/to/file/SamReader.py <input-file.sam> -options <output-file.txt>

SamReader can analyse mutliple files at once (output files fields are optionnal):
$ ~/path/to/file/SamReader.py <input-file1.sam> <input-file2.sam> -options <output-file1.txt> <outpute-file2.txt>


**** OPTIONS ****

Choosing from one of the following options is MANDATORY :
-t	show the results in the terminal, without saving them in a file
-o	save the results in a file which name is given by the user, or in the default file "summary_data_file.txt"
-t -o	show the results in the terminal AND save them in a file


**** HELP ****

$ ~/path/to/file/SamReader.py -h	access help to show the different sections available and choose one of them,
					or enter directly in the terminal one of the following terms :

Sections:
-hf	show details about the FLAG field
$ ~/path/to/file/SamReader.py -hf

-hc	show details about the CIGAR field
$ ~/path/to/file/SamReader.py -hc

-hr	show details about the requirements to run the programm
$ ~/path/to/file/SamReader.py -hr

-hs	show details about the SAM file format
$ ~/path/to/file/SamReader.py -hs

-hp	show details about the programm
$ ~/path/to/file/SamReader.py -hp


**** OUTPUT ****

The output is the same weither you choose to store it or not and is presented as follow :
